# Change Point Analysis and Statistical Modelling of Time Series Data

## Project Overview
This project aims to perform change point analysis and statistical modeling on time series data. The goal is to detect changes in the data and associate potential causes for these changes.

## Main Goals
1. **Change Point Detection**: Identify significant shifts in the time series data that may indicate underlying changes in the process generating the data.

2. **Statistical Modeling**: Develop statistical models to understand the behavior of the time series before and after detected change points.

3. **Cause Association**: Investigate and associate external factors or events that may contribute to the identified changes in the time series data.

4. **Data-Driven Insights**: Provide actionable insights for stakeholders to better understand the dynamics of the time series and make informed decisions.

## Data
The project will utilize historical time series data, which will be processed and analyzed to achieve the project goals.
